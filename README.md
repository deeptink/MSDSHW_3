The repository is created to organize the homework for week 3.

For Question 1, We used following

For Question 2, We extracted the data from /Users/dee/Data Science/GitHub/MSDS6306_HW3/awesome-public-datasets/Datasets/titanic.csv" and calculated the mean for Age, Fare and Survvied. Ensured that the data doesnt include NA.

For Question 3, Create a function which reads the data from csv file - "http://talklab.psy.gla.ac.uk/L1_labs/lab_1/homework/sleep_data_01.csv" and do calculations on Median, Min/Max, Standard deviation and range of variables.

For Question 4 & 5, Reading the data from packages - fivethirtyeight and doing set of calculations.
